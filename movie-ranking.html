<h3>1. The lord of the rings trilogy</h3>
<p>This is by far the best triology and seperate movies ever, the storytelling the action, the music, the scenery everything is absolutely top notch.</p>
<h3>2. Never back down 2008</h3>
<p>This movie is a great mma action packed emotional rollercoaster of a movie, with great characters, great aesthatics and it is very easy to follow, maybe a bit predictable.</p>
<h3>3. Pirates of the carribean davy jones locker</h3>
