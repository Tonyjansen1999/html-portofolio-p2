<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Tony Jansen born in Venlo the netherlands on the 26th of april 1999. i am a tall skinny relaxed guy that likes spending time with games, tv shows, movies or with friends.
  Sports that i like to watch are football (soccer for the americans), f1 and ufc.
</p>

<p>Growing up i never knew 100% what i would want to do in the future in terms of my career, so when i had to decide for which high school i had to go to i decided to do something which i already knew alot of, this was animal care.
  Although i was pretty good at it i had a hard time getting along with the people in the sector and i wasnt enjoying the work. but alteast it was fairly easy for me to get my degree and get a job in the field, and maybe things would change.
  So once i started working in the sector (i worked for 2 years with geuinea pigs) i realized that this shouldnt be my future because it just became such a drag getting up and getting ready for work which i did not enjoy at all. so this is when i decided to change fields and try to start web development.
</p>

<p>So far i have enjoyed my journey and learnt alot along the way, i have also began a course through duolingo which teaches me spanish, and i will be working part time very soon.
  But this means i still have time tking the web development and the spanish course and being able to workout in the gym atleast 3 times a weak.
